# About This App

## Introduction

Welcome to this interactive tool for evaluating **Under-Five Mortality (U5M) reduction performance** across African countries from **2000 to 2019**, adjusted for healthcare spending per capita.

While most global health metrics focus on absolute declines in U5M, this app asks a deeper, more equitable question:

> _"How well did countries perform, given the resources they had?"_

This shift in perspective helps identify countries that **outperformed expectations**‚Äîthe potential **Exemplars**‚Äîas well as those where outcomes **fell short relative to investment**.

---

## Why This Study Matters

This work has direct applications for organizations such as **Exemplars in Global Health (GV)**, the **World Bank**, **UNICEF**, and **WHO**, as they strive to:

- Benchmark country performance more **equitably**
- Guide **evidence-based resource allocation**
- Identify **positive deviants** for deeper learning and policy transfer

By comparing child mortality outcomes relative to investment levels, this tool supports **smarter, fairer evaluations** of progress.

## Methodology Snapshot

### ‚úÖ Stochastic Frontier Meta-Analysis (SFMA)

At the heart of this tool is a **novel frontier methodology**, co-developed by our team. It represents a **major leap forward** in performance benchmarking by:

- Accepting **standard errors** in mortality and spending estimates  
- **Trimming outliers** automatically (a key limitation in earlier methods)  
- Delivering more **robust, context-aware results** without relying on rigid assumptions

üìå This method was successfully used in a World Bank-supported analysis and was later **acknowledged for correctly removing outliers** that distorted prior results.

üß† It outperforms conventional tools like DEA or parametric SFA‚Äîmaking it one of the **most advanced frontier approaches currently available** for health systems analysis.

### Visual Example: Outlier Trimming in Action

The image below shows how our method effectively removes outliers, creating a more realistic and policy-relevant benchmark as compared to all other available methods.

## Data Sources

- **Under-Five Mortality Rates**: UNICEF, World Bank, IHME  
- **Health Expenditure per capita**: World Development Indicators  
- **Coverage**: African countries with consistent data, 2000‚Äì2019

## Who Should Use This Tool?

- Global health funders (GV, World Bank, GAVI, UNICEF, WHO)  
- Ministries of Health and Planning  
- Researchers and analysts focused on health system performance  
- NGOs working in child health, accountability, or impact measurement

Second phase of the project that assesses governance and human resources that explain inefficiencies  have been conduted but not included here. We have found some interesting results.

## Let‚Äôs Collaborate

We believe this tool can inform the next wave of global health decision-making.
