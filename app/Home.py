# About This App

## Introduction

Welcome to this interactive tool for evaluating Under-Five Mortality (U5M) reduction performance across African countries from 2000 to 2019, adjusted for healthcare spending per capita.

While most global health metrics focus on absolute declines in U5M, this app asks a deeper, more equitable question:

> "How well did countries perform, given the resources they had?"

## Why This Study Matters

This work has direct applications for organizations such as Exemplars in Global Health (GV), the World Bank, UNICEF, and WHO, as they strive to:

- Benchmark country performance more equitably
- Guide evidence-based resource allocation
- Identify positive deviants for deeper learning and policy transfer

By comparing child mortality outcomes relative to investment levels, this tool supports smarter, fairer evaluations of progress.

## Methodology Snapshot

At the heart of this tool is a novel frontier methodology, co-developed by our team. It represents a major leap forward in performance benchmarking by:

- Accepting standard errors in mortality and spending estimates
- Trimming outliers automatically (a key limitation in earlier methods)
- Delivering more robust, context-aware results without relying on rigid assumptions

This method was successfully used in a World Bank-supported analysis and was later acknowledged for correctly removing outliers that distorted prior results.

It outperforms conventional tools like DEA or parametric SFAâ€”making it one of the most advanced frontier approaches currently available for health systems analysis.
